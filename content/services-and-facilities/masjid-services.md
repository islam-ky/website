The masjid at the time of the prophet was more than just a place of worship. It was a place for the community to meet and for problems to be solve. Similarly, we aspire to create a similar environment here in Islamic society. Here are some of the services we run:

- Nikah(marriage) ceremonies
- Marriage counselling and advice
- Funeral and bereavement services
- Provides periodic educational conferences/ workshops
- Participating in and facilitating outreach and interfaith activities to build bridges with other faith-based communities and leaders
- Pastoral counselling
