The masjid at the time of the prophet was more than just a place of worship. It was a place for the community to meet and for problems to be solved. Similarly, we aspire to create a similar environment here in The Islamic society. Here are some of the services we run:

* Nikah (marriage) ceremonies including marriage talks and negotiations
* Marriage counselling and advice
* Funeral and bereavement services
* Provides periodic educational conferences/ workshops
* Participating in and facilitating outreach and interfaith activities to build bridges with other faith-based communities and leaders
* Pastoral counselling for the youth and elders
* Community services including aid and help to the overlooked parts of society. Also, initiatives such as cleaning and maintaining public spaces
