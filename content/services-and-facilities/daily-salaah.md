Sayyiduna Abdullah bin Umar رضي الله عنه says that he heard our beloved Nabi ﷺ saying:

“The prayer offered in congregation is twenty-seven degrees more rewardable than a prayer offered by a single person.” (Bukhari, Muslim)

Alhamdulillah, five times salaah takes place in congregation at the masjid. Please try to attend.

The Friday sermon and prayer are led by the imam. The talk in English will begin at approximately 1:10
