After Esha salaah every Friday, sisters gather to learn and meet. This is an ideal opportunity for the sisters to learn their Deen and meet other Muslim sisters of the community. Classes will be conducted by the imam and the sisters. The imam will explain a short surah of the Quran and what lessons and values are learnt. Then imam will relate stories from the lives of influential women from the past.
