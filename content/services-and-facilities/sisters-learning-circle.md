A monthly evening event, sisters gather to learn and meet. This is an ideal opportunity for the sisters to learn their Deen and meet other Muslim sisters of the community. Classes will be conducted by the imam and the sisters. The imam is currently going through the lives of the wives of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). This includes lessons and wisdoms that can be learnt as well as contextualizing theories and teachings. The program concluded with an open and relevant Q + A session.  

This is an informal and relaxed session in which children and non-muslims are welcome. refreshments are available at the conclusion of the program.
