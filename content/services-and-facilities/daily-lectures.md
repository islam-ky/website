Sayyiduna Abu Umamah (radiyallahu ‘anhu) reports that Rasulullah (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:

“Whoever sets out towards the Masjid for the purpose of learning or teaching knowledge will receive the reward of a Haji whose Haj was perfect”

(Al Mu’jamul Kabir, Hadith: 7473)

Lectures take place in the masjid straight after the isha salaah on a variety of topics as follows

Monday- Fiqh of wudhu and salaah with evidences from Quran and Sunnah
Tuesday- The 7 key beliefs of Islam
Wednesday- Fiqh of nikah and advice for a happy marriage
Thursday- Lessons and guidance from the Seerah (life of the beloved messenger saw)
Friday- Description of the hereafter and the unseen
Saturday- Praiseworthy qualities of a believer
Sunday- Anecdotes from history
The Prophet said, “Does not one of you go out in the morning to the mosque to learn or recite two verses from the Book of Allah Almighty? It is better for him than two camels, three is better than three, four is better than four and whatever number of camels.” Sahih Muslim

Therefore, after the Fajr salaah, one verse of the Quran will be explained so that we can understand the word of Allah. Currently Surah Yaseen(described as the heart of the Quran by Rasool saw) is being explained.
