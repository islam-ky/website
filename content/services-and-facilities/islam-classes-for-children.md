The future of Islam directly depends on how much time we invest in our childrenâ€™s Islamic and intellectual growth. That is why we need to ensure our children receive Islamic education alongside their other academic studies. That is why classes are held regularly in the masjid aimed at children.

After school classes are held for children aged 5-9 from 2:30 to 4:30 from Monday to Thursday.

Islamic school for children aged 10-15 takes place between Maghrib and Isha salaah from Monday to Thursday.

Sunday School operates from 11 o clock till Dhuhr salaah at 1:15 for children of all ages.

In these classes, students will:

Learn how to recite the Quran correctly with the correct pronunciation and rules
Memorize often recited surahs with understanding of core themes and messages of each surah
Ground themselves in core Islamic beliefs regarding Allah, his messengers and the hereafter.
Learn everyday fiqh(theology) which will taught with practical demonstrations where necessary- such as how to perform wudhu and salaah
Study Islamic history with a focus on the lives of the prophets and their companions
Inculcate within themselves Islamic conduct and morals
Commit to memory duas for the day and sunnahs to act upon through the day
