# New Mosque Project
## Purchase Your House in Jannah Today

**The First Ever Purpose-Built Masjid in the Cayman Islands**

> *"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed of grain which grows seven spikes…"* — Qur'an 2:261

**Invest in a house in Jannah for you and your family - This will be a continuous reward till the day of Judgement**

## Our Project History

Muslims began to congregate for Jumuah in the early 2000's at a private residents. At that time, a handful of people would turn up for the Friday prayer. Before long, a need arose for a convenient place so a unit was purchased in 2010 and has been in use until the present day.

## Achievements and Progress

ALHAMDULILLAH, IN THE RECENT PAST, THE COMMUNITY HAS:

- **Tripled in congregation size**
- **Had huge turn-outs for Ramadhan programmes** prompting us to move outdoor and rent the neighbouring unit
- **Over 25 reverts to Islam**
- **A first full-time Islamic and Hifdh class**
- **A resident qualified Imaam to lead the community**

*Our current facility during prayers - clearly beyond capacity*

## Need for Expansion

Alhamdulillah, due to growth, the current location has become inadequate. We lack:

- **Space for congregations and parking** (2 Jumuah take place due to lack of space)
- **Suitable space for sister and children** (we currently use one entrance for all)
- **Classroom and Day-care facility**
- **Suitable accommodation for an Imaam**
- **Venue for interfaith and other community events**

## The New Masjid

The new venue will see to all our current needs as well as give us space to further grow. The Masjid will accommodate the growing congregation, an Imaam and any visitors and guests interested in Islam.

The Masjid will also be located at a busy junction, ensuring many more eyes will be drawn to Islam and giving us a foothold on Island for many years to come.

### What the New Masjid Will Accommodate:
- **Spacious prayer halls** for men and women (200+ capacity)
- **Separate entrances** maintaining Islamic etiquette
- **Islamic school classrooms** (20+ students capacity)
- **Multipurpose community hall** for events and outreach
- **Imam's residence and office** for pastoral care
- **52 parking spaces** with internal access
- **Modern kitchen facilities** serving the community
- **Daycare center** for Muslim families
