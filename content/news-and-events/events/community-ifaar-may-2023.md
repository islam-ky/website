Hope you are well

## Special Monday Community Fast

This Monday, we are holding a **community fast** at ISCI.

## About This Special Fast

Our beloved Prophet (S.A.W) would love to fast on **Monday and Thursday**.

Also, it can count to our **6 fasts of Shawwaal** which equal in reward to an entire year's fast.

## Event Details

We should try to make use of the **public holiday** to fast and open our fast in the Masjid.

**The iftar is open to:**
- Those who fast 
- Those who can't fast (all welcome)

## Benefits

- Follow the beloved Sunnah of Monday/Thursday fasting
- Opportunity to complete the 6 fasts of Shawwaal
- Community bonding through shared iftar
- Spiritual reward equivalent to a full year of fasting

## What to Expect

- Community iftar meal after Maghrib
- Opportunity to break fast together
- Welcoming environment for all community members

We look forward to sharing this blessed meal with our community family!
