As salaamu alaikum
ISCI cordially invites you and your family to our Eid prayer and celebration at the park adjacent to the Public beach(near Kimpton).

Please dress appropriately, park in suitable places and bring your own prayer mats.
Take extra care with children especially through the prayer itself.
Those who can bring some food are welcome to as well as those who wish to give there names to volunteer and come early to the site/masjid.
