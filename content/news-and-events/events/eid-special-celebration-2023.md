## Local Muslim Community Marks Eid with Special Celebration

The local Muslim community recently came together to celebrate the festival of **Eid al-Fitr**.

## About Eid al-Fitr

The festival marks the **end of the month of Ramadan** during which Muslims fast, not consuming food and drink from sunrise to sunset.

## Community Celebration Highlights

### Ramadan Observance
Imam Noor Bhana, of the Islamic Society of the Cayman Islands, said that in Cayman Muslims also observed the fasting according to their own capacity.

**"It teaches patience, gratitude, discipline and sympathy for the poor,"** he said, adding that the entire community of **more than 100 men, women and children** would gather daily and break fast together after sunset.

### KPMG Partnership Initiative
This year, the Islamic Society of the Cayman Islands said, **KPMG Cayman's office** also held an open fasting challenge for its employees of all faiths with **more than 30 individuals** from various backgrounds participating.

Those volunteers:
- Fasted the entire working day
- Listened to a speech delivered by Imam Nooh
- Broke their fast together

**"This was an initiative which increased bonding between communities and cultures as well as educating the participants about Islamic practices."**
