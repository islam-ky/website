The Islamic Society was established in 2000 to cater for the needs of the Muslim society on the Cayman Islands. As well as a place of worship, it is a community hub, providing education for children and adults as well as social events and activities. A wide range of services are offered here such as counselling and other social services. It also presents the true teachings of Islam as a religion of tolerance, cooperation and peaceful harmony amongst all people who lead a life of balance, justice and mutual respect.
