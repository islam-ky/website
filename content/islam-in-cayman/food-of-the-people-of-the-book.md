In the Quran 5:5 , Allah says that the food of the people of the book is permissible for Muslims to eat. People of the book in the Quran refers to the Jews and the Christians. Here, the verse is telling us that if the animal is slaughtered according to the rules mentioned in the bible and the Talmud then it is Halal for consumption. Some of these rules are as follows:

1. All blood must be spilt
2. Not carrion
3. The name of the lord of the world is taken
4. The trachea must be cut

So, if these laws are followed then food slaughtered by the people of the book would be permissible for consumption. But as Muslims, especially with regards to our intake, we must take extra precautions. Remember that how we sustain out body impacts our worship and dua.  And the reality is that within so-called Christianity, many cults have been born who slaughter in the name of Satan and other beings.

Therefore, keeping all this in mind, the correct and most cautious for the Muslims of Cayman Islands is that we first try to obtain meat slaughtered by Muslims. If not available, then we should restrict ourselves to seafood and vegetarian options. And as for kosher certified meat, it may be consumed as the Jewish community is still strict upon its slaughtering guidelines.
