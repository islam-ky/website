Allah has ordered Muslims to eat halal food just as he ordered the prophets when he says in the Quran

يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلرُّسُلُ كُلُوا۟ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَـٰتِ وَٱعْمَلُوا۟ صَـٰلِحًا ۖ إِنِّى بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌۭ ٥١

`O messengers! Eat from what is good and lawful, and act righteously. Indeed, I fully know what you do.`

يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُلُوا۟ مِن طَيِّبَـٰتِ مَا رَزَقْنَـٰكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِلَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ ١٧٢

O believers! Eat from the good things We have provided for you. And give thanks to Allah if you ˹truly˺ worship Him ˹alone˺.

As Muslims, we must ensure that what we consume is halaal. This is a very important injunction from our shariah(legislation) for which we can’t be neglectful of. That’s why wherever we are, we should make it our habit to search for places where halal food can be purchased.
