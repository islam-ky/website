Gelatine is a clear, tasteless protein that thickens and solidifies liquid and comes commonly from animal collagen. It is processed from animal bones and skin. It can also be extracted from vegetables but this is rare. Gelatine of animals such as pig, beef and fish are commonly found in food and medicine so what is the ruling regarding its consumption?

After the gelatine is extracted, it is then processed through pre-treatment of acid or alkaline. It is also heated and cleansed thoroughly whilst being decomposed through hydrolysis.

The question is whether the product at the beginning is still in essence, the product at the end. This is due to the fact that the Sharia has taken into consideration when the essence and nature of something changes, and ruling can change accordingly. Take for example the fact that alcohol in impure and impermissible whereas grapes and vinegar aren’t.

Therefore, based upon the above principal and after taking the opinions of leading chemists and specialists, the majority of scholars say that the structure of the gelatine does radically change.  This is the opinion of the Maulana Khalid Saifullah, the Islamic Fiqh Academy and other scholars.  But some scholars do maintain that the structure doesn’t sufficiently change. This is the ruling given by the Islamic Fiqh Council amongst others. Scholars such as Mufti Taqi Uthmani maintain that it will be permissible if the change occurs but that is for the chemists to determine and not the scholars.

To summarise:

1. If the gelatine is artificial or plant based, then Halal
2. If the gelatine is from an animal slaughtered islamically or by the people of the book, then Halal
3. If the gelatine is in medicine which is necessary, then Halal (It is still better to try and remove the medicine from the capsule if possible as the gelatine is used primarily in the capsule for protection)
4. If the gelatine is from any other source, then it is better to avoid as we are taught to stay away from doubtful things. But if there is a need and great difficulty in finding alternatives, then the ruling of permissibility may be taken.

*And Allah knows best.*
